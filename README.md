Assignment: Variables in TypeScript

Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to reinforce the understanding of variables in TypeScript and their usage.

Instructions:
1. Create a new TypeScript project using an appropriate code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Initialize a TypeScript file (e.g., `variables.ts`) for this assignment.
3. Complete the following tasks in the TypeScript file:

Task 1: Variable Declaration and Initialization
- Declare and initialize variables of the following types:
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean

Task 2: Variable Types
- Declare a variable without explicitly specifying its type and observe the inferred type.
- Declare a variable with an explicit type and assign a value of a different type to it. Observe the resulting behavior.

Task 3: Variable Scoping
- Demonstrate the concepts of block-scoped and function-scoped variables.
- Declare a variable inside a block and try to access it outside the block.
- Declare a variable inside a function and try to access it outside the function.

Task 4: Constants
- Declare a constant variable using the `const` keyword and assign it a value.
- Attempt to reassign a value to the constant variable and observe the error.

Task 5: Template Literals
- Use template literals to create a string that incorporates values of variables.

Task 6: Dynamic Typing
- Show how TypeScript allows dynamic typing by declaring a variable without specifying its type initially and then assigning values of different types.

Submission:
- Submit the TypeScript file (`variables.ts`) with comments explaining each task.
